## 1. P, NP, NPC, NP-Hard Problems
- P class problem:solvable in polynomial time.
- NP class problem:verifiable in polynomial time.
  P = NP? The existence of NPC problem leads to suspect that P is not equal to NP.
- NPC class problem:NP problem as hard as any other NP problem.
- NP-Hard class problem:More hard problem than NPC.

## 2. Very similar problems could have very different complexity

## 3. Deal with intractability
- approximation algorithms
- Prune heuristic algorithms
- greedy algorithms or other suboptimal algorithms
